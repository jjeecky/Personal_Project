### Project Description

Built a program that allows users to check who among their Instagram following does not follow them back. 
Inspired by peers around me that wanted to check this easily, since social media is a big part of people at this ageâ€™s lives. 
Apps exist that have the same function, but most of them require payments for the feature. 
Built using Python, and I have tested multiple times to check that it works as planned. 
Planning on developing it further to make it into a functioning application. 


### How to use:
**1.** 
Although the instructions will show once you run the code, here is a brief description:
Run using the code:
python3 Demo_insta.py

This will print this introduction:
Hello, welcome to FollowerInspector. This program will check who among the people you follow don't follow you back.
To get started, we need lists of your followers & following.
If you do not know how, type 'idk'. If you already have used our code before, type 'skip'.

**2.**
Type 'idk' to view instructions, where you will be able to see:
1. Go to your instagram app.
2. Click the 3 bars and go to 'Your Activity'.
3. Now scoll to the very bottom and click 'download your information'.
4. Click download or transfer information and select the account you want to check.
5. Now choose 'Some of your information & select 'Followers & Following' 
6. Select Download to device and select date range to all time and press create files.
7. Your files will be sent to your email. Once you have gotten them, download them and put them in the same file as this code. 
Now you are all set!

    (Note* It will take some time for the files to be ready for download, give it some time, around 10-20 minutes).

**3.** 
After uploading the necessary files, the results of the list of users will be presented.
